# Multi-Asset Portfolio Strategy

This project implements a simple backtest of an equal-weighted portfolio consisting of multiple asset classes:

- AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- TSLA (Tesla Inc.)
- PFE (Pfizer)
- BTC-USD (Bitcoin)
- GLD (Gold ETF)
- SPY (S&P 500 Index ETF)

The goal is to simulate the cumulative return of this diversified portfolio from 2019 to 2024, and evaluate its performance using key financial metrics.
